    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Profit?</h2>
        <p>Profit is the amount of money a business earns after covering all its expenses. In simple terms, profit is what’s left over when you subtract the costs from the earnings.</p>

        <div class="formula">
            <strong>Formula to Calculate Profit:</strong><br>
            Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)
        </div>

        <p><strong>Selling Price (SP):</strong> The price at which you sell the product.<br>
        <strong>Cost Price (CP):</strong> The price at which you bought the product.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Suppose you buy a book for ₹200 (Cost Price) and sell it for ₹300 (Selling Price). To find the profit:
            <br><br>
            Profit = ₹300 - ₹200 = ₹100<br>
            So, your profit is ₹100.
        </div>

        <h2>What is Loss?</h2>
        <p>Loss occurs when the costs of producing or buying a product are higher than the revenue from selling it. It means you spent more money than you earned.</p>

        <div class="formula">
            <strong>Formula to Calculate Loss:</strong><br>
            Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)
        </div>

        <p><strong>Selling Price (SP):</strong> The price at which you sell the product.<br>
        <strong>Cost Price (CP):</strong> The price at which you bought the product.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Suppose you buy a toy for ₹150 (Cost Price) and sell it for ₹100 (Selling Price). To find the loss:
            <br><br>
            Loss = ₹150 - ₹100 = ₹50<br>
            So, your loss is ₹50.
        </div>

        <h2>Simple Steps to Calculate Profit and Loss</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Determine the Cost Price (CP):</strong> This is how much you spent to buy or produce the item.</li>
            <li><strong>Determine the Selling Price (SP):</strong> This is the amount you received from selling the item.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Profit or Loss:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If SP > CP, then:<br>
                    Profit = SP - CP</li>
                    <li>If SP < CP, then:<br>
                    Loss = CP - SP</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is Profit and Loss Important?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Health:</strong> Profit shows how well a business is performing, while loss indicates areas where the business might be struggling.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Understanding profit and loss helps in making informed decisions about pricing, budgeting, and investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> It helps in planning future expenses and investments to improve the overall financial stability of a business.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
        <p>Imagine you run a small lemonade stand.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Scenario 1:</strong><br>
            - You spent ₹50 on lemons, sugar, and cups (Cost Price).<br>
            - You sold the lemonade for ₹80 (Selling Price).<br><br>
            To calculate your profit:
            <br><br>
            Profit = ₹80 - ₹50 = ₹30<br>
            So, you made a profit of ₹30.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Scenario 2:</strong><br>
            - If you had spent ₹80 on ingredients and sold the lemonade for ₹50:<br><br>
            Loss = ₹80 - ₹50 = ₹30<br>
            So, you would have a loss of ₹30.
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Profit and loss are fundamental concepts in business and finance. Profit occurs when your selling price is greater than your cost price, and loss happens when your cost price is greater than your selling price. By understanding and calculating these values, you can better manage finances, make informed decisions, and gauge the health of a business.
