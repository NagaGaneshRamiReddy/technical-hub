            <h2>Introduction to Compound Interest</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal amount. This means that future interest is calculated on the new total, which includes both the original principal and the previously earned interest. Compound interest can significantly increase the total amount of interest earned or paid compared to simple interest.</p>

            <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
            <p>Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It differs from simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount.</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <strong>Formula to Calculate Compound Interest:</strong><br>
                A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt)<br>
                <strong>Where:</strong><br>
                A = Amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.<br>
                P = Principal amount (the initial sum of money).<br>
                r = Annual interest rate (decimal).<br>
                n = Number of times that interest is compounded per year.<br>
                t = Time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Principal (P):</strong> The initial amount of money.<br>
            <strong>Annual Interest Rate (r):</strong> The interest rate per period.<br>
            <strong>Number of Times Compounded (n):</strong> How frequently the interest is applied each year.<br>
            <strong>Time (t):</strong> The number of years the money is invested or borrowed.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                Suppose you invest ₹10,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded quarterly for 3 years. To calculate the amount:
                <br><br>
                A = 10000 (1 + 0.05/4)^(4*3)<br>
                A = 10000 (1 + 0.0125)^(12)<br>
                A = 10000 (1.0125)^(12)<br>
                A ≈ 10000 * 1.1616<br>
                A ≈ ₹11,616<br>
                Therefore, the amount after 3 years is approximately ₹11,616.

            <h2>How to Calculate Compound Interest</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify the Variables:</strong> Determine the principal, annual interest rate, number of compounding periods per year, and the total time in years.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply the Formula:</strong> Substitute the values into the compound interest formula and perform the calculation.</li>
                <li><strong>Compute the Amount:</strong> Solve the formula to find the total amount after interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate the Compound Interest:</strong> Subtract the principal from the total amount to find the interest earned.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why is Compound Interest Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investment Growth:</strong> Compound interest helps investments grow more quickly than simple interest, making it a powerful tool for long-term savings and investment strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Loan Costs:</strong> Understanding compound interest can help in managing and comparing loan costs, as compound interest can lead to higher overall repayment amounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> Using compound interest calculations can aid in planning for future financial goals, such as retirement or major purchases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>Imagine you are saving money for a future goal:</p>

            <div class="example">
                <strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
                You save ₹5,000 in a bank account offering an annual interest rate of 4% compounded monthly for 5 years. To determine how much money will be in the account after 5 years:
                <br><br>
                A = 5000 (1 + 0.04/12)^(12*5)<br>
                A = 5000 (1 + 0.003333)^(60)<br>
                A = 5000 (1.003333)^(60)<br>
                A ≈ 5000 * 1.2214<br>
                A ≈ ₹6,107<br>
                Therefore, the total amount after 5 years is approximately ₹6,107.
            </div>
