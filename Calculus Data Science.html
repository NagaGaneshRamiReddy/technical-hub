        <h2>Introduction to Calculus</h2>
        <p><strong>Calculus</strong> is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change through derivatives and integrals. It plays a crucial role in data science by enabling the analysis of change, optimization, and modeling. Calculus helps in understanding how different variables interact and how to optimize functions, which is essential for building and refining data models.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Calculus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Derivatives:</strong> Derivatives represent the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables. In data science, they are used to optimize functions and understand how changes in inputs affect outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrals:</strong> Integrals represent the accumulation of quantities. They are used in various applications, including calculating areas under curves and aggregating data.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Derivatives:</strong> Partial derivatives are used when dealing with functions of multiple variables. They help in understanding how a function changes with respect to each variable independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Calculus is used to find the maximum or minimum values of functions. This is important in machine learning algorithms to minimize cost functions and improve model performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Gradient Descent:</strong> A popular optimization technique that uses derivatives to iteratively adjust parameters to minimize a cost function. It is widely used in training machine learning models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Derivatives</h2>
        <p>Derivatives measure how a function's output changes as its input changes. In data science, derivatives are used in optimization problems and to understand the sensitivity of models to input changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Derivative:</strong> Indicates the slope of the function and provides insight into its rate of change.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher-Order Derivatives:</strong> Provide information about the curvature and concavity of the function, which helps in understanding its behavior in more detail.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Integrals</h2>
        <p>Integrals calculate the accumulated area under a curve, which can represent the total quantity of interest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definite Integrals:</strong> Used to compute the total accumulation over a specific interval.</li>
            <li><strong>Indefinite Integrals:</strong> Represent the general form of antiderivatives and are used to find functions whose derivatives are known.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Partial Derivatives</h2>
        <p>Partial derivatives are used when dealing with functions of multiple variables. They help analyze how changes in one variable affect the function while keeping other variables constant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gradient Vector:</strong> Combines all partial derivatives and indicates the direction of the steepest ascent in a multidimensional space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Optimization</h2>
        <p>Optimization involves finding the best solution from a set of feasible solutions, often by minimizing or maximizing a function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Functions:</strong> In machine learning, cost functions are optimized to improve model accuracy by minimizing errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Constrained Optimization:</strong> Optimization problems that include constraints, where solutions must satisfy certain conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gradient Descent</h2>
        <p>Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize cost functions by adjusting parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning Rate:</strong> Controls the size of the steps taken towards the minimum. Too large a rate can overshoot the minimum, while too small a rate can lead to slow convergence.</li>
            <li><strong>Batch Gradient Descent:</strong> Uses the entire dataset to compute gradients and update parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):</strong> Uses a single data point to compute gradients and update parameters, which can lead to faster convergence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Calculus in Data Science</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Optimization algorithms like gradient descent rely on calculus to train models effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Modeling:</strong> Calculus helps in building and refining models that describe data patterns and relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Derivatives and integrals are used in various predictive modeling techniques to forecast future trends.</li>
        </ul>
